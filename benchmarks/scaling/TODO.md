- [ ] Create a script `pregenerate.py` to pregenerate the synthetic data
  - [ ] First, find/generate the probe to use during the pregeneration
    - [x] Modify the `Probe` class in `circusort.io` to handle path management outside `__init__`
    - [x] Implement method to generate a probe
    - [x] Implement method to save a probe

    - [x] Implement method to generate some templates
    - [x] Implement method to save some templates
    - [x] Implement method to load some templates
  - [x] Find/generate the trains to use during the pregeneration
    - [x] Implement method to generate some trains
    - [x] Implement method to save some trains
    - [x] Implement method to load some trains
  - [ ] Generate the signal (i.e. raw data)
    - [x] Add gaussian noise to the signal
    - [ ] Add template waveforms to the signal
- [ ] Move the utils from `utils.py` to `circusort`'s core
- [ ] Explain how to use a non-empty initial template dictionary (in the README)
