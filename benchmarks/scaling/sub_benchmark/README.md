In this sub-benchmark, we analyse the real-time performances of a
sub-network composed of a `reader` block and a `writer` block.

To execute this benchmark use the following instructions:

1. Change your current directory  
`cd ~/circusort/benchmarks/scaling/sub_benchmark`
1. Launch IPython  
`$ ipython`
2. Launch *(not available yet)*  
`In[1]: %run main.py`

You can alternatively use one of the following instructions for step 2.:

- Launch the generation only  
*(not available yet)*  
`In[2]: %run main.py --generation`
- Launch the sorting only  
(generation must have been executed before)  
*(not available yet)*  
`In[3]: %run main.py --sorting`
- Launch the introspection only  
(generation and sorting must have been executed before)  
*(not available yet)*  
`In[4]: %run main.py --introspection`
